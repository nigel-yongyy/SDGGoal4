        <h1>Why Does It Matter?</h1>
        <p>Over 200 million children will still be out of school in 2030</p>

        <div class="row">

                <h3>Why does education matters?</h3>
                <p>Education is the key that will allow many other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved. When people are able to get quality education they can break from the cycle of poverty. Education therefore helps to reduce inequalities and to reach gender equality. It also empowers people everywhere to live more healthy and sustainable lives. Education is also crucial to fostering tolerance between people and contributes to more peaceful societies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="matter-column">
                <h3>Where are people struggling the most to have access to education?</h3>
                <p>More than half of children that have not enrolled in school live in sub-Saharan Africa, which makes it the region with the largest number of out-of-school children in the world. And this region has a very young population so it will have to provide basic education to 444 million children between the ages of 3 and 15 in 2030, which is 2.6 times the numbers enrolled today.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="matter-column">
                <h3>Are there groups that have a more difficult access to education?</h3>
                <p>Yes, women and girls are one of these groups. About one-third of countries in the developing regions have not achieved gender parity in primary education. In sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania and Western Asia, girls still face barriers to entering both primary and secondary school. These disadvantages in education also translate into lack of access to skills and limited opportunities in the labour market for young women.</p>
